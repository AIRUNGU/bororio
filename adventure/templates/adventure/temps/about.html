<p>Descriptive checklists provide additional assistance by indicating, for example, the specific variables to be measured to characterize each component. Scaling checklists go a step further and include simple devices for assessing importance or significance of suspected impacts. This might be through the use of letter or numeric scales, assigned after comparison with criteria supplied in the checklist, to indicate the importance of an impact. Another approach is to use threshold values, based on statutory criteria (e.g. for water quality standards) or on derived measures (e.g. visitor carrying-capacity for a given locality). The suspected impact can be estimated in broad terms and given a value to represent its significance. On that basis, a start can be made on comparing and ranking alternative project options</p>
